## Under the Hood: SAGE's Unusual Architecture

The AN/FSQ-7 was fundamentally different from modern computers. This simulator models several of SAGE's unusual architectural features:

### One's Complement Arithmetic
- **Not two's complement**: Uses one's complement binary representation (two zeros: +0 and -0)
- **Fractional values**: Numbers represented as fractions between -1.0 and +1.0
- **Parallel processing**: Each 32-bit word contains TWO 16-bit values processed simultaneously
- **Implicit shift quirk**: Addition automatically shifts right by one bit (programmers had to pre-compensate!)

### Drum-Buffered I/O
- **No direct I/O**: CPU never talks directly to radar, consoles, or other sites
- **Magnetic drum intermediary**: All external data written to dedicated drum fields (LRI for radar, GFI for ground radar, XTL for cross-tell)
- **Status channel polling**: CPU continuously polls status bits to detect when new data arrives
- **Asynchronous operation**: Input systems write to drum independently while CPU runs

### Light Gun Polling
- **Not mouse coordinates**: Light gun used a photomultiplier tube that detected the CRT electron beam
- **Sequential detection**: CPU draws each target, then polls a flip-flop bit to see if the gun "flashed"
- **Timing-based**: Selected target identified by which draw operation triggered the photomultiplier
- **Polling required**: CPU must check status after EVERY draw operation

These architectural quirks made SAGE programming challenging but enabled real-time operation with 1950s technology. For technical details, see [`docs/HIGH_FIDELITY_EMULATION.md`](docs/HIGH_FIDELITY_EMULATION.md).
