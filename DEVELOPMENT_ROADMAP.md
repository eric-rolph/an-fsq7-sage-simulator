# SAGE Simulator - Development Roadmap

**Status:** Radar Display Fixed ✅  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Current Phase:** Core Interactions & Track Management

---

## ✅ COMPLETED: Radar Display Foundation

### Achievements
- **P7 Phosphor CRT Simulation**: Authentic dual-layer canvas (blue fast decay + green slow persistence, 0.012 decay rate)
- **React Lifecycle Solution**: Canvas replacement detection (100ms polling) survives React re-renders
- **Geographic Overlays**: East Coast, Great Lakes, range rings, cities, bearing markers
- **Rotating Sweep**: 6° per second with additive phosphor trails
- **Track Rendering**: Color-coded dots with 1.5-second phosphor persistence trails

### Technical Foundation
- Canvas 2D rendering @ 60 FPS with dual-layer persistence
- Continuous canvas monitoring (100ms polling) detects React replacements
- Clean separation: Python state → JSON (data divs) → JavaScript (crt_radar.js) → Canvas
- Automatic initialization on page load (no manual console commands)

## ✅ COMPLETED PRIORITIES (Core Features)

### Priority 1: **Track Lifecycle & Correlation** ✅ COMPLETE
**Persona:** Ada (CS/engineering student)  
**Learning Objective:** Understand detect → correlate → classify workflow
**Status:** Implemented and committed (commits fd5ec4d, 4c58f60, f5d565e)

#### Features to Implement:
1. **Track State Visualization**
   - New track appears as "UNCORRELATED" (yellow + question mark)
   - Correlation process shows "CORRELATING..." status (2-3 seconds)
   - Successful correlation → classified type (hostile/friendly/unknown)
   - Show confidence level (LOW/MED/HIGH) based on radar returns

2. **Manual Correlation Override**
   - Light gun click on uncorrelated track → opens classification panel
   - Operator can manually classify: Hostile / Friendly / Unknown / Ignore
   - Shows why auto-correlation failed (weak signal, no IFF, etc.)
   - **Meaningful play:** Manual classification changes track color immediately

3. **Track History Panel**
   - Side panel showing track lifecycle: First Detection → Correlation → Classification → Current
   - Shows raw radar data: altitude, speed, heading, IFF response
   - **Cognitive fidelity:** Mirrors real SAGE correlation process

**Implementation:**
- Add `track.correlation_state: str` (uncorrelated/correlating/correlated)
- Add `track.confidence_level: str` (low/med/high)
- Add `track.correlation_reason: str` (auto/manual/iff/visual)
- Create `components_v2/track_classification_panel.py`
- Update CRT radar to show correlation state visually (different shapes/colors)

### Priority 2: **Interceptor Assignment** ✅ COMPLETE
**Persona:** Sam (sim/games player)  
**Learning Objective:** Make tactical decisions with visible consequences
**Status:** Implemented and committed (commits c8a8be9, d6dc8bf)

#### Features to Implement:
1. **Interceptor Launch Panel**
   - List of available interceptors with:
     - Type (F-89, F-102, etc.)
     - Location (base name, distance to track)
     - Fuel status, weapon load
     - Status (ready/scrambling/airborne/engaging/returning)
   
2. **Assignment Workflow**
   - Light gun select hostile track → shows threat assessment
   - Click "ASSIGN INTERCEPTOR" button
   - System suggests best interceptor (closest, adequate fuel, armed)
   - Operator can override selection
   - **Meaningful play:** Assignment creates intercept vector on radar (blue dashed line)

3. **Engagement Visualization**
   - Interceptor track appears on radar (blue icon + trail)
   - Intercept vector updates in real-time as aircraft closes
   - Distance countdown: "120 mi → 100 mi → 80 mi..."
   - Weapon range indicator: "IN RANGE" when <10 miles
   - Engagement result: "SPLASH ONE" (success) or "MISS" (failure)

**Implementation:**
- Add `sim/models.py`: `Interceptor` dataclass
- Add `state_model.py`: `InterceptorState` with location, fuel, status
- Update `simulation_tick_loop()`: Move interceptors toward targets
- Create `components_v2/interceptor_panel.py`
- Add intercept vector rendering to `crt_radar.js`
- Add engagement outcome logic (probability based on distance, weapon type)

### Priority 3: **System Inspector Overlay** ✅ COMPLETE
**Persona:** Ada (CS/engineering student)  
**Learning Objective:** See "inside" the computer system
**Status:** Implemented and committed (commit 4db3781)
**Features:** CPU state panel, 16 memory banks visualization, queue inspector with bottleneck warnings, Shift+I toggle

3. **Educational Scenarios** ✅
   - **Demo 1 - Three Inbound** (beginner): Basic detection and threat prioritization
   - **Scenario 5 - Correlation Training** (intermediate): Manual classification practice
   - **Scenario 6 - Equipment Degradation** (advanced): Tube failures under pressure
   - **Scenario 7 - Saturated Defense** (expert): Resource allocation with 8 targets, 3 interceptors

4. **Performance Tracking** ✅
   - `ScenarioMetrics` dataclass: tracks detection, classification, intercepts, timing
   - Event handlers: `close_debrief()`, `restart_scenario()`, `next_scenario()`, `complete_scenario()`
   - State fields: `scenario_complete`, `scenario_start_time`, `scenario_metrics`
